Barber App - Intelligent Appointment Booking System
Welcome to the Barber App, an intelligent appointment booking system built using Vite, React, TypeScript, and integrated with Firebase for database management and an emailing system. This app provides a seamless experience for both barbers and clients, ensuring efficient scheduling and preventing double bookings.

Features

Appointment Scheduling: The app incorporates a real-time appointment setting calendar that updates every 30 minutes. It automatically removes past time slots to maintain accuracy and availability.
Database Integration: Firebase database is utilized to store appointment details and client information for future reference and streamlined management.
Email Notifications: When a client books an appointment, the barber (you) receives an email notification with the time and date of the booking, ensuring prompt awareness of all scheduled appointments.
User Authentication: To book an appointment, users are required to sign up, which includes email verification to prevent fake or faulty emails. Verified emails are stored securely in the database, allowing users to remain signed in via local storage. This enables a simplified booking process for returning users.
Token-based Authentication: A special authentication token is generated upon successful email verification. This token is used to authenticate returning users during subsequent appointments. If the token matches the stored token in the database, the appointment is booked immediately. Otherwise, the user is prompted to fill in the form again and undergo the email verification process.
Resend Email Verification: In case users encounter difficulties in email verification, a resend button is provided to facilitate the process and ensure a smooth user experience.
Mapbox Integration: The app includes an embedded Mapbox image, providing users with a visual representation of the barbershop's location.
